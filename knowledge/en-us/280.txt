Eyes in the Dark is a black human-shaped mass with two white eyes on the head and two hands with very long fingers.
No feet or legs are visible, as the lower portion of the body appears to fade away several centimeters from the ground.
It is hostile to humans; avoids light, although light doesn't harm it. If this entity can't find a path to a dark place,
it will try to teleport there.
