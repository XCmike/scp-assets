 Fertile Soil - has the ability to grow any plant or organism to its full potential in a relatively short amount
 of time (the length varies according to the complexity of the organism).
 Nothing growing in SCP-124 requires external nutrients or other resources.
 Pesticides aren't needed, too, because SCP-124 has a repellent effect on any insect or other invertebrates not
 growing in it.
